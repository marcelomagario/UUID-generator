As a free server, it might take some seconds to wake-up the server and load the backend.

Stack:
TypeScript, Express and React. 

Just setup the .env-example that I left to make it easier.

To start the backend:

`
cd backend
npm start
`

to start the frontend in another terminal:

`
cd frontend 
npm start
`

to navigate on your local

`
http://localhost:3000
`
